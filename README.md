EnsPy is a collection of tools for reading, visualizing, and extracting information from ensemble forecasts data.

EnsPy follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org) in its version number. For a version `0.x.y`, I change `x` when I
release new features, and `y` when I make a release with only bug fixes.

Other required packages:

- Numpy
